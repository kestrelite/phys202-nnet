    "# Averaging Neural Network Output for Improved Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple neural networks can be used to improve output accuracy. By performing a weighted average on the output vectors, it is possible to create a setup wherein multiple networks have found local minima, but together have a higher net accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "This occurs, intuitively speaking, because while one network might fall into an inaccuracy, a large number of networks are unlikely to agree on that inaccuracy if trained in disparate ways. That is what the following methods accomplish.\n",
